Code reading exercise:


Question 1:
arch/mips/locore/trap.c
When trap occurs, control transfers from the user software to the OS.
When an interrupt occurs, control transfers from user software to the kernel. 

Question 2:
kern/include/syscall.h

Question 3:
The libc functions in the "common" part is shared by the kernel and the user program. On the other 
hand, the libc functions in userland/lib/libc are only used by the user programs.

Question 4:
It configures "target hardware platform and machine type" and "default location of the root of the 
installed system". The configuration is invalidated if the file name of the root is changed.

Question 5:
Different machines have different hardware, for example, the number of processors. The implementation 
of some functions are dependent on the hardware. It's important to maintain the separation so that 
we don't need to change all the code when we switch to a different machine; we can just change the 
functions that are affected. By using modularity, the OS codes can be easily used on different machines.

Question 6:
The size of the trapframe is machine dependent.

Question 7:
We should rerun configure if we moved the source tree to a different computer that is running a 
different OS.

Question 8:
We should rerun bmake depend when we change header file inclusions, or after re-running config. 

Question 9:
We should rerun bmake when we want to recompile the kernel. We should rerun bmake install if we want
to copy the kernel to the root folder.

Question 10:
We need to add code in "~/os161/src/kern/main/menu.c". First, we need to add the command to the 
list "static const char *opsmenu[]", in the format of"[(command to be typed) Print hello world]". 
Then, we need to create a function as the following: 
static int cmd_hello(void)
{
	kprintf("Hello world!\n");
	return EINVAL;
}

Question 11:
The OS needs to implement these utilities.

Question 12:

Question 13:
